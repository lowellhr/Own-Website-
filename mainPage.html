		<!--May add more paragraphs later.  Just first rough draft right now -->
		<p>Hello!  My name is Hannah Lowell and you have entered my site explaining who I am, what I have done, what are my goals, what I like doing, etc.  It is a resume but on a website!</p>

		<p>The purpose of this site is to show not only my skills in creating my own website, but it also will show what else I can do and what I have done.  It is evidence of what I can do, that I can show to future employers I may want to apply for.</p>

		<p>I even will have a page explaining why I want to go for the computer programming field and how I came about with that decision.</p>
